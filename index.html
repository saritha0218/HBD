            <h3>My Dear Mammu,</h3>
            <p>
                Wishing you a very happy birthday! May your special day be filled with joy, love, and laughter. You're not just my boyfriend, you're my best friend, my confidant, and the love of my life. Thank you for always being there for me, for making me smile, and for loving me unconditionally.

                I've always dreamed of being your Ammu forever. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I wouldn't trade you for the world. If there's one decision that I'll never regret, it's falling in love with you and accepting your love.
                
                I want to spend the rest of my life with you, marry you, raise our kids, and take care of our parents. I want to love you with the intensity of a thousand sunsets, the gentleness of a summer rain, and the eternal devotion of the stars.
                
                <br>Happy Birthday, my love.
            </p>
            <p>Love always,<br>Ammu ❤️</p>

                <h1>The Sory of US</h1>
                <p>Two 17-year-olds, a boy and a girl, stood at the gates of Avanthi St. Theresa College, ready to embark on their journey into B.Tech. Their hearts were filled with a mix of excitement and nervousness as they stepped into a new chapter of their lives.
                   <br>⭐This was the first step into a world they had only imagined—a world of learning, challenges, and new experiences. The sprawling campus welcomed them with its towering buildings and the buzz of students all around. They didn’t know what lay ahead, but one thing was certain: this was the start of a journey that would shape their future.<br>A few days later, one of the girl’s friends talked about the boy to her. She mentioned how she had chatted with him the previous night. “He seems like a good person,” she said.
                    <br>⭐Later, the boy approached her and asked if he could borrow her bike to go outside the college for something. She handed him the keys to her scooty without hesitation.
                    <br>⭐You know who are those, You walked up to me nervously and asked, “Can I borrow your scooty for a quick errand?” It was our first interaction, but I handed you the keys without hesitation. You thanked me with a relieved smile and hurried off, leaving a small smile on my face.

You’ve stood by me whenever I needed you, faced countless challenges with me, and made sacrifices that mean the world to me—like giving up friendships with other girls just because you know how over-possessive I can be 💖</p>

I’ll do everything I can to solve them and be by your side, not just for now, but until the end of our days together ❤️.</p>
                        <p>I dream of a life where we raise our kids, watch them grow into independent souls, and smile as we see our granddaughters and grandsons playing around us. Mammu, I promise to fight for us, to make us one, and to patiently wait until my family accepts you. I’ll never stop loving you, no matter what. You’re my forever ❤️.</p>
